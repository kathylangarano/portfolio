I developed this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the game, you have the option to choose a single player, and within the canvas-based map, you engage in battles against another player.

Each player is equipped with a selection of five attacks, which could involve water, fire, or earth-themed abilities, and the victor is determined based on their performance.

One noteworthy feature of the game is the impressive 3D carousel displayed at the beginning, showcasing all available players. I would appreciate your feedback on this aspect.
