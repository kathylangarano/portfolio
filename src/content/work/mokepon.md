I made this game with html, css and javascript. In the game you can choose 1 player and in the canva map you going to be able to fight with another player. 
Each player has 5 attacks it could be water, fire or earth attack and the best player will win. 
I love the cool 3D carousel at the beggining showing all the players that are available. Do you like it?
