This is a project where I created an e-commerce web page for an eco-store to sell organic crafted fashion items.

This project was focused to implement Sass At-rules, with a beauty and minimalist design.

I added an article style at the beginning of the web page, 2 sections of product cards, a gallery section, location and a footer to add important information about.

The product cards have a beauty design that allow to add a description and photo.
