This project involves the creation of an e-commerce website for an eco-store specializing in the sale of organically crafted fashion items.

The primary focus of this project was the implementation of Sass At-rules, with an emphasis on achieving a beautiful and minimalist design.

The website features an introductory article-style section at the beginning, followed by two product card sections, a gallery section, location information, and a footer containing essential details.

The product cards are designed with aesthetics in mind, allowing for the inclusion of descriptions and photos.
